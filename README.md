### Bookmark Spotlight

An easier way to filter through your bookmarks and bookmark folders in Chrome.

##### To-do list / current work in progress:
* [x] - Implement a proper `react` / `reflux` flow
* [x] - Create `SearchItems` based on search results from the `SearchStore`
* [ ] - Introduce `eslint` for better dev flow
* [ ] - Change all code to ES6 standards
* [ ] - sass
* [ ] - Enhance search
    * [ ] - Search while typing
    * [ ] - Custom search algorithm
    * [ ] - Input debounce / polling for realistic feel
    * [ ] - Spinner for aesthetics

##### Ideas:
* Add keywords to bookmarks for improved searching
* Store bookmarks in a better structure, or traverse the tree for searching (only need {ID: Title})
